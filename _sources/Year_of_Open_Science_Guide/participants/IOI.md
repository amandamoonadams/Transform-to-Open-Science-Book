Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) works to increase the investment in and adoption of open infrastructure to further equitable access to and participation in research. In the current systems for scholarly research and knowledge production where extractive practices place unreasonable costs on researchers and institutions, lock up knowledge, and privatize data, we are excited to be part of the Year of Open Science to work with peers in the space and the broader community to explore models to shift the dynamics towards one that calls for more accountability and reinvestment to advance a healthy and vibrant open research ecosystem.
